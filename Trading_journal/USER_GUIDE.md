2. **Performance Issues**
   - For very large datasets (>10,000 trades), consider filtering by date range
   - Close other resource-intensive applications when running the application

3. **Visualization Problems**
   - If charts are not displaying correctly, try refreshing the page
   - Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version

4. **Calculation Discrepancies**
   - If you notice P&L calculation discrepancies, check your commission and swap fee values
   - Verify that your entry/exit prices and quantities are correct
